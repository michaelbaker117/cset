After completing the first course, how would you rate yourself? Is there anything you want to do differently to start the next course?
After completing the first course I'd give myself a 6 out of 10 rating because I still feel like I am a beginner. Of course, 4 weeks ago I knew nothing
at all about programing so I was a complete beginner to this course. However, looking at all the knowledge i've gained from this class so far, I feel like
I'm an average programer.

The Weresquirrel program showed many uses for JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Using variables and values from this example, explain the 
difference between the two data structures.
An object is a collection of properties, aka keys, with values stored inside those keys. Those values can be any data type. Objects use the curly brackects. An array is an object built like a list.
Instead of keys, arrays have elements which hold values. Those values are bound to an index according to its order. The collection of elements can be any size and the values
can be any data type. Arrays use the squar brackects. For example,
let object = {
 key: value,
};
let element = [
 list,
 of,
 values,
];

Now explain why the author chose to use one structure over the other for each example you chose. Follow the same reasoning and 
explain how you could have used objects and arrays in your adventure game from last week.
The author I belive chose to use an array for the Weresquirrel program. I think he chose this because he needed a list. For my adventure game from last week
I think I could have used an array for one of my scenes. In the bossRoom scene the adventure is prompted with a question and is asked to choose a weapon from three
different choices. I could have used an array to put those choices in a list.
