After two weeks, what do you is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?

I think my biggest challenge is taking too long to write code for a problem. I can write the pseudocode for it almost right away but its becoming a challenge for me.
In order to over come this challenge I will ask the tutors and my group for help. I have a hard time asking for help, which is another challenge I have to overcome. Speaking
with my group and the tutors will help with that, as well.

Describe the difference between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do while.

The for loop is like a counter. For loops have a starting value, an ending value, and a changing value. After each cycle the ending value is changed based on the changing value,
then the loop repeats. The while loop changes based on a certain condition in the loop, usually with if/ else statements. The do while loop does something while it executes a 
contition in the loop.

We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is it important and
how will it help you in future classes?

Writing the solution in English or pseudocode is important becasue it is easier to read for humans and it gives the reader a clear understanding of what your code is doing.
Writing pseudocode for me will help in future classes because writing down the thought process for the code is important.
