How do you feel about the pace of the program so far? Is it too slow? Too fast? Or just right?
So far, I think the program is going at a decent pace. I don't think its going too slow or too fast. However, I feel that some people may not be given enough time to
work on projects or assignments if they're due within a few hours. I believe we should have time until midnight to work on assaignments or projects, especially if
we run into issues coding. If we are given more time we can ask for more help when needed.

Why do you think functions are a useful tool to organize large programs?
Using a function provides an easier way to read someone else's code. If there is a large program with lots of lines of code, problems can occur and create bugs. Using a
function can help us find where in the program that bug is and fix it. A function is also useful in keeping things long if statements or loops short.

In class, we've been using the analogy of a zoo to explain scope. Describe the difference types of scope using this analogy and provide examples using real JavaScript code.
One type of scope, is the global scope. The global scope is what happens outside of a function. The 2nd type of scope, is the local scope. The local scope is what happens
inside a function. For example:

// create a zoo function
// if "lion" is an animal return true
const zoo = function(animals) {
  if ("lion")
  return true;
};
console.log(zoo("lion"));
The Global scope is the zoo function as well as console.log().
the local scope if the the if statement and the return statement.
