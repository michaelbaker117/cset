Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?
I think HTML isn't owned by one person or company because the world wide web was created to be accessed by everyone. Everyone and anyone can make a website. HTML is an open
standard for anyone to be abe to create a website on any browser, new or old.

Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.
A tag is the begining and end of your line of code which contains the content. The element is the open/close tags and content as a whole. For example,

<p>This is the content</p>
The <p></p> are my open/close tags. The element is the tags and content.

In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.
For the Yoda quote, "The greatest teacher, failure is," this isn't grammarly correct but we as humans can understand that this is meaning, failure is the greatest teacher.
This relates to semantics because we can understand the meaning of the quote even though it isn't grammarly correct.
For the Noam Chomsky quote, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously," this is grammarly correct except we don't really understand the meaning. This relates to syntax because
the quote is written correctly but we don't understand the meaning of the quote.
