Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?
I have several years of working experience and have been able adapt to certain situations, either with co-workers or customers. I've always had to do hard work
during my shifts so, I feel confident that I'll be able to adapt to a different work environment than what I'm use to. I'm really proud of myself for choosing CSET
as my major and will stick with it to become a profecinal.

Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, 
walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.
I could use the onclick property to move to the client to the next page. Then, use onload to load the page with a description of the next room.

Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?
Data structures are useful because they organize stored data. Looking through all the different data structures I think the DOM could work as an array because in 
a DOM you can add, remove, or replace nodes in different areas of the structure. In an array, you can also, add or remove keys or values of an array.
