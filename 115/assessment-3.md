What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?
I think the most difficult aspect of deleoping a project in a larger group is merge conflicts becuase with a larger group you'll have so many people working on the
same project that there's bound to be some conflicts when merging every local remote to the origin remote. I also, think that there will be times when someone
merges their local remote and it breaks the rest of the code in the origin remote.

Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.
Branches are a series of commits that diverge or converge to work in parallel. These are created when you make a commit from the master branch. A remote is a copy
of the original repository stored on another computer. When you clone a repository from github it creates a default master branch.

For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?
I think for the project we used the feature branching workflow because we were creating a branch from the master branch to make changes. Then, when we pushed our
changes we had to make a pull request. A feature branch workflow is whn you create a new branch then push your changes and make a pull request.
