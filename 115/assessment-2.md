In the next few weeks, we'll be learning how professional developers work on larger projects. What are you most looking forward to in this section?
I am mostly looking forward to working together with a team on 1 single project. I think team work is a key aspect to creating a finished project. I believe that
all team members have value, even if one team member isn't capable of doing each piece of the project. I think each person has strengths and weaknesses, so if
someone is skilled at one thing put them in charge of that piece of the project. If one person in a team is struggling then the whole team will struggle.


Briefly explain event propogation and bubbling using an example of two nested HTML elements.
Propogation is when the browser reads the most specific event handler which is ead first the the rest of the event handlers come after. Bubbling is when the
browser reads the last event handler, then bubbles upward to ead the rest of the event handlers.

You learned to use addEventListener on a DOM node to listen for a type of event and create a function to handle that event. When the event happens, 
that function is called with an Event Object that gives you more information about the event. Choose two different event types and explain two properties of 
each that are unique to that event. Use your MDN reference for help.
