This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped 
more than regular tests or quizzes?
I think answering the assessment questions helped me a lot because it gives me the chance to think about what I know or what I don't know. I think in the future
I'll be comfortable answering these questions in interviews.

In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what 
it does and why that's important.
Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example.
When comparing the Waterfall vs the Agile methodologies, the Agile method seems more efficient for bigger companies. The Waterfall method starts out with getting the requirements for 
a project, then moves in a straight line go on to the next stage of the development process. With this method you have to wait until the previou stage has finished 
before moviing forward. I think for the Tic-Tac-Toe game my partner and I used the Waterfall method. We started out with writing down the requirements, then moved to 
designing what the game would look like. After that, we started coding the Javascript. The Agile method, however, takes small parts of the bigger project so that 
you can develop something while having something out there for your users.
